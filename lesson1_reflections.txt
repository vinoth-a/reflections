Lesson GIT 1

Importance of software versioning
      Can track all the  changes done from the first version
      Esier to restor to the previous version 

File comparison  done manually and using tools provided in different operating systems
   There are higher chances of missing typos if  versions are compared manually.
   Its better to use any of these tools which will improve the productivity greatly.

                        COMMIT

A commit is snapshot of every file  in the repository at the time of commit


In Software project, multiple files may be closely related to each other.  Hence it makes sense to track the files together rather than individually     


GIT Clone
    Copies the entire repository with all the versions to local a specified local repository.  Since the entire repo is copied locally, Most of the things can be done locally without connecting to net.

GIT Log
    Used to get list of full commits done on the repo.  It also displays the commit comments.

GIT Diff
    Used to get the difference between two GIT commit points

By using version control i can go back to any of my the previous versions of my software and find out what was the behavior then.  I can use git diff to find the chagnes between two version,that has caused the  change in behavior
